## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) represents the biggest change to JavaScript in the last 20 years. JavaScript is the language of the web, and ES6 is a major improvement for web developers, adding much-needed features such as classes, promises, arrow functions, generators, string templates and many others. Browser support is growing and transpilation tools such as Babel allow you to get started coding in ES6 today.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Dan Wellman will help you sharpen your JavaScript skills by learning some of the most important additions that ES6 brings to the language. Cutting-edge web development practices are increasingly relying on ES6, so knowledge of the new features is becomming more and more necessary. So let's get started!


## Source Files Description


The source code package contains a number files and folders at the root. The `dist` folder contains the compiled JavaScript ES6 source code. The `js` folder contains all of the example code that we'll be working with in the course. It contains a series of files that map to individual lessons, and it should be clear which file matches which lesson by the filename.

There is also a Babel configuration file, a Grunt configuration file and a HTML page for testing purposes. This page links to the babel-polyfill and in some lessons we link to the compiled `es5.js` file, while in other lessons we make use of the `es6.js` file.
